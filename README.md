# Your Next Stop!

## This project examines user input on restaurants to determine their next restaurant destination. The features examined are:

    * The restaurant's cuisine

    * An image from the restaurant's YELP page

    * The restaurant's price range

    * The restaurant's rating

    * Whether the restaurant allows reservations

    * Whether the restaurant delivers

    ### The user will then choose whether they would order food from the restaurant displayed and based on 5 - 10 decisions from the user, we will use machine learning to determine the best restaurant for the user
